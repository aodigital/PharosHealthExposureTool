    <p>
        The last level of control available to protect workers from RCS dust is Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
        Up until now, the controls have been focused on prevention and proactively controlling exposure risks through
        systems and strategies aimed at minimizing dust and separating workers from emission sources. PPE is a reactive
        control. The purpose of PPE is to protect workers in environments where hazards are present and cannot be avoided
        through proactive efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining exposure level helps determine the appropriate respirator type and other PPE to protect workers.
        In general, the higher the remaining exposure level, the more significant (and cumbersome to workers) PPE becomes.
        PPE can be uncomfortable for workers and can make it more difficult to perform work activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the remaining exposure level, there are certain PPE that are typical for certain work activities
        and work environments. These include worker decontamination clothing and equipment.
    </p>
    <p>We'll now present the recommended PPE.</p>
